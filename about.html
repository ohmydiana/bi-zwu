          <h1>WHO AM I</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a daughter, sister, girlfriend, aunt and to some people a good friend I believe.
            In my (still kind of short) life I already got to experience so many valuable things, 
            got to see plenty of beautiful places and feel countless amazing feelings, all of which I'm 
            greatly thankful for.
          </p>
          <p>
            All throughout my life, I couldn't find the right box to fit myself in, which has been both my blessing 
            and my curse. Curse, because of this constant desire to try new things to fit to, which 
            is not always possible so then the FOMO kicks in. Blessing, because of all the things I already 
            got to try, whilst finding the right box for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            While attending high school, I thought the right path for me would be business and economics, so 
            I applied to Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda, the Netherlands. However, it didn't 
            take long for me to realise that the world of business isn't really the best fit for me, so I decided 
            to make a little change in my plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a deep rethink of my life, I applied to Czech Technical University in Prague for a Computer Science 
            study programme, which is my current study (let's just hope the last one :D). I really think that 
            technology and IT is the way to go for me, although it has it's downsides too.
            Just as about everything in life.

        <h2>MY EDUCATION JOURNEY</h2>
        <p>
          This timeline represents my education journey all the way from the elementary school 
          up until the university I attend now. Although there have been many times of momentary 
          regret and breakdowns, I couldn't be more glad for all the people, knowledge and 
          memories this journey gave me.

              The elementary school I attended.
              What I remember the most from my stay at this school are 
              the friendships I made, because those are the strongest ones I have to this day.

              As much as I hesitated to apply to this grammar school, it may have been one of the 
              most important (good) decisions I've made in my life. The school prepared me well for my 
              higher studies and gave me some of the most valuable things I have.

              I attended an International Business programme at this university, which I shortly realised 
              wasn't the best fit for me. However, I am altogether very thankful for the experience it brought me.

              My current university, at which I am attending the Computer Science programme. So far, it has 
              been a really bumpy ride at this school, considering it's very intense educational level.
