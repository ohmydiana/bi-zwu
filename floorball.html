          I started playing floorball probably when I was in 7th grade of elementary school, when me and my friends were looking for a new hobby. 
          Playing floorball taught me a lot about competition, how to celebrate winning but also how to deal with losing, which I consider 
          a very valuable lessons.

            My and my friends started in a small gym floor in Dubnica, where I grew up, and then worked our way to NTS Nemšová, a well-known floorball club in Trenčín region. 
            We stayed there for 3-4 years, during which we managed to enter a lot of competitions around the country, as well as outside of it.

            We entered the Prague Games 2018 and 2019, which is one of the biggest international floorball tournament for the youth held regularly in July in Prague, 
            the capital of the Czech Republic.

            During my high-school years, I played the floorball league between the high-schools in Slovakia. In my final year of high school (2023), we have won 
            the whole competition and became the <b>National Champions in high-school floorball league</b>. That notes as one of the best high-school memories I have.

            Currently, I am a part of the the faculty floorball team at CTU in Prague, where I study. Our team has a very male-dominated structure, so sometimes it can 
            be a little harder for me to be an asset there, but every match is always a great experience here.
